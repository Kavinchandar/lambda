# lambda (Backend)
Building a cool support chatbot that can answer based on contextual data (fine tuning LLMs and RAG)


1. Frontend (User Interface)
React Native + Expo

2. Backend (API & Orchestration)
FastAPI (Python): Simple, async, integrates with ML easily.

3. LLM Layer
Base Model: Open-source → LLaMA 3, Mistral, or Falcon (smaller 7B-13B for cost).
Fine-Tuning:
LoRA/QLoRA with Hugging Face + PEFT.
Training on your domain support tickets / FAQs.
Serving:
vLLM or text-generation-inference → optimized inference server.
Deploy on GPU cloud (RunPod, Lambda Labs, or AWS).


4. RAG Pipeline
Embedding Models: text-embedding-ada-002 (OpenAI) or sentence-transformers (open-source).
Vector Database:
Pinecone → managed, easy.
Weaviate → open-source + production-ready.
pgvector → if you want to keep it simple inside PostgreSQL.
Document Loading & Splitting: LangChain or LlamaIndex.


5. Storage & Infra
Relational DB: PostgreSQL → store user sessions, auth, analytics.
Deployment:
Frontend: Vercel.
Backend: AWS (ECS/Fargate) or GCP Cloud Run.
Vector DB: Pinecone SaaS or self-host.


6. Observability & Scaling
Logging: OpenTelemetry + Grafana.
Queue: Redis or RabbitMQ if async processing needed (batching queries).
