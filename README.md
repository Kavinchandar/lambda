Build Your Own “Search-Powered” Document Copilot (Backend)
 

Stack: Python (FastAPI), Elasticsearch for document indexing/search, LangChain for LLM/RAG pipeline, React or Streamlit for UI, REST/GraphQL API layer, and optional AWS for hosting.
Flow:


Upload docs to app → parsed & indexed in Elasticsearch.


User asks questions → LangChain orchestrates retrieving relevant chunks from Elasticsearch (or external web via Perplexity), sends to an LLM for answer synthesis with citations.


UI displays answers—sources, highlights, feedback, export/share features.
